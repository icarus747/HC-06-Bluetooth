# HC-06-Bluetooth

Script to configure a DSD TECH HC-06 bluetooth Serial Transceiver to communicate with a Raspberry Pi 2b+ and 3. Connect
to the pinouts from this link:
http://helloraspberrypi.blogspot.com/2015/11/raspberry-pi-bluetooth-serial-terminal.html

This will allow you to increase the baud rate of your HC-06 for better cli throughput. Or to communicate with other
devices that use a different baudrate. 

The script runs and asks questions about what you want to do.  It is a loop so you must break out of it. 

Video explains what is going on (I'm not the author of it)
